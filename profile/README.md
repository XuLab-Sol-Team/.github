## [Wirefree_Miniscope_Staircase](https://github.com/XuLab-Sol-Team/Wirefree_Miniscope_Staircase)

Use Wirefree Miniscope to observe the Hippocampal CA1 region activity in single-neuron accuracy while navigating in a 3-D arena.

## Solysis

A highly-integrated pipeline for data analysis for multi dimention time-sequence data in neuroscience includes behavior and neuron activity, will have standard data types and structure, statistic & plot tools for those pre-identified variables with some unknown variables. 

## EZ cell counter

Semiautomatic tool for neuron counting, will automatically detect the coordinates of neurons in microscopy fluorescence image, while supports manually circle areas on the image and output the standard statistical data for further analysis.
